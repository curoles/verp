VERP - Verilog ERB Pre-Processor
================================

VERP purpose is to simplify and automate Verilog coding,
similar to Verilog EP3 and RobustVerilog pre-processing tools.
VERP takes text with Verilog code and Embedded Ruby code and
process it all into Verilog code.

# File name conventions

Recommended file name is:
* `*.v.erb` or `*.erb.v` - for Verilog or
* `*.sv.erb` or `*.erb.sv` - for SystemVerilog

# Usage
verp-run.rb is executable Ruby program. To run it from the shell (CLI) issue:
```
verp-run.rb [options] filename
```

By default `verp-run.rb` uses the standard output for its results. This can be
changed by using the following command line flag:  
`-o outfile` or `--output outfile`

# Basic concepts
VERP simply uses Ruby ERB templating system. VERP output for the file with pure
Verilog code will be identical to the original input file. To embed Ruby code into
Verilog use ERB delimiters `<%` and `%>`; alternativly, lines starting with a `%`
sign are interpreted as Ruby as well.

```
<%# Instantiate DFF 3 times -%>
<% 3.times do |i| -%>
    Dff ff(.d(d<%=i%>), .q(q<%=i%>), .clk(clk));
<% end -%>

```
or
```
% # Instantiate DFF 3 times
% 3.times do |i|
    Dff ff(.d(d<%=i%>), .q(q<%=i%>), .clk(clk));
% end

```

VERP also defines helper functions (API) that user can call from embedded Ruby,
for example output for following line:
```
// Autogenerated on date <%=date%> from <%=input_file_name%>
```
will be something like:
```
// Autogenerated on date 2014-09-04T21:07:25-07:00 from some_file.v.erb
```
